# CASA Lib

CASA Lib was a flexible ActionScript 2.0 & 3.0 library designed to streamline common chores and act as a solid, reliable foundation for your projects. It provided a core set of classes, interfaces, and utilities to get you coding faster and more reliably without getting in the way.

* Standardizes the loading of external files with an easy-to-use and consistent API.
* Complete and meticulous documentation with examples for every class and utility.
* Memory management made so much easier through a common `destroy();` method.

## About

CASA Lib (formerly CASA _Framework_) was created by [Aaron Clinger](https://aaronclinger.com) in 2005 and released publicly in January 2007. Its original aim was to be flexible enough for use across the diverse types of projects encountered in the advertising industry.

In 2006 Aaron joined [Odopod](https://www.odopod.com), a digital design studio in San Francisco. The studio supported CASA Lib by dedicating company time to its development. While at Odopod, Aaron met coworker [Mike Creighton](https://www.mikecreighton.com), who quickly became CASA Lib’s co-lead.

Since its original release, CASA Lib has been heavily supported by community feedback, bug reports and code contributions. All code authors have been credited in the ActionScript classes to which they contributed.

CASA Lib was under active development until late 2011 and was one of the most popular ActionScript libraries. It was used by many agencies, startups, and Fortune 500 companies.
